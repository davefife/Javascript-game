# Javascript-game
game I wrote in Javascript and html5  you can play it at www.davefife.com/profile.html

it's now late 2018 and this was made probably around 2013 or 14 I forget.
  The code is not as organized as it needs to be, I can work with it,
but I wrote it in a sloppy way; a lot of things can be improved.  Despite that, I think it was a success, as my goals for myself were met.

  So the game itself has controls that are touch-screen overlaid on the edges of the screen.
if you look closely you will see white text. The idea was to have the text be 
less noticeable as you figure out the controls for yourself.  Its a Dragon Warrior/Quest 1
inspired thing.  I took sprites from the old NES Dragon Warrior, if I ever decide to go back to this project,
replacing the sprites is a mid-level priority.  There isn't an ending or final boss fight,
this is a common criticism.  I was not concerned with that, but maybe sometime I will go back.





All the best,
Dave
