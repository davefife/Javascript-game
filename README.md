# Javascript-game
game I wrote in Javascript and html5

it's now late 2018 and this was made probably around 13 or 14 I forget.
  The code is not as organized as it needs to be, I can work with it,
but I wrote it in a sloppy way with global vars. after coding this, I studied design patterns,
and that was helpful. Basically needs refactoring, modularity, data hiding, clear names, a lot of things can 
be improved.  Despite that, I think it was a success, as my goals for myself were met.

  So the game itself has controls that are touch-screen overlaid on the edges of the screen.
if you look closely you will see white text. The idea was to have the text be 
less noticeable as you figure out the controls for yourself.  Its a Dragon Warrior/Quest 1
inspired thing.  I took sprites from the old NES Dragon Warrior, if I ever decide to go back to this project,
replacing the sprites is a mid-level priority.  There isn't an ending or final boss fight,
this is a common criticism.  I was not concerned with that, but maybe sometime I will go back.

It served three purposes:
1. Learning
2. Demonstration
3. Attempt at keeping traffic on my site for more than a second or two.

goals were moving forward - be aware of code quality. 



All the best,
Dave
